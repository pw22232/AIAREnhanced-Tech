## Frontend

### Problems
#### 1. Dynamic Previews Can Be Unreliable:
SwiftUI's live previews are a powerful feature for real-time UI design and development. However, they can sometimes be buggy or fail to refresh properly, requiring me to restart Xcode or clean your build folder.

#### 2. Integration with Existing Codebases:
When adding SwiftUI to an existing UIKit or ARKit project, I encounter challenges in integrating the two frameworks seamlessly, especially around data sharing and event handling.

### Solution
#### 1.Dynamic Previews Can Be Unreliable: 
Consider the actual effect of the code before previewing, and restart Xcode or clean your build folder.

#### 2. Integration with Existing Codebases:
Start with small, incremental changes to manage risk and ensure smooth data and event integration between the frameworks using SwiftUI's data management tools and the Combine framework.

## AR Interactions

### Problems
#### 1. Limited Documentation and Resources：
Since ARKit is a relatively new framework, I mainly looked up the documentation on the Apple website to learn how to use it. However there are a lot of problems for which Apple doesn't have a clear official solution, the actual cost of learning is much higher.
       
#### 2. Difficult practical interaction structures:
Because the actual AR scene needs to contain many models as well as many complex interaction actions, it is not easy to be able to establish the structure of the entire AR interaction.

### Solution
#### 1. Limited Documentation and Resources：
According to the official Apple documentation, try to incorporate multiple tricks of ARKit at the same time. Finally, I'm be able to build more functionality.

#### 2. Difficult practical interaction structures: 
Sort out the logical relationship between AR interactions and AR scenarios, and the hierarchy of different models.
